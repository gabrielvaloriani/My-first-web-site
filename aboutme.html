      <div>
        I finished a technical course in school to become a chemist in 2023.</br> </br>However, in the years that followed, I struggled with my studies and realized that I had pursued it solely to satisfy my parents and secure financial stability.</br>
        </br>During my teenage years, I didn't have any specific goals or aspirations for my future career.</br>
        </br>When I turned 18, I became interested in personal finance and personal growth. I learned about concepts such as the F.I.R.E. movement and the basics of the investment world.</br>
        </br>The following year, I became involved in the world of cryptocurrency, initially out of curiosity and for speculative purposes. However, I soon became fascinated with the wild market trends and wanted to understand the underlying technology. As they say, soon I fell into the "rabbit hole",
        I delved into Blockchain technology and web3, realizing that they represented a revolution not only in the financial sector but also beyond.</br>
        </br>Now, I am studying to become a blockchain programmer at Start2Impact University. This opportunity has allowed me to pursue my passion and have a way to find work in the sector that excites me the most.
