              This project was made for a small non-profit organization that focuses on lifestyle to improve their way of raising and managing charitable funds. The main goal was to create a fundraising portal based on blockchain technology that would make everything transparent, trustworthy, and efficient throughout the whole fundraising process. </br>
              </br>Thanks to the smart contract created, the fundraising process has been improved, providing transparency at every stage of donated money lifecycle. Donors can now track how funds are being used in real-time, resulting in maximum clarity and trust in the nonprofit's activities.</br>
              </br>Moreover, the use of blockchain technology has simplified the process of receiving funds, by removing intermediaries and streamlining the financial management process. Every transaction is securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and facilitating the demonstration of appropriate use of funds.</br>
              </br>As a result, the fundraising portal not only provides transparency and trust but also enhances the operational efficiency of the non-profit organization, enabling it to focus more on its mission to make a positive contribution to the community.</br>

              </br>We accomplished an analysis and created a report for a startup in the fashion-tech industry. Our goal was to help the company understand and adopt Web3 tools and protocols that were tailored to their specific needs.</br>
              </br>Our report provides a detailed examination of the differences between Web2 and Web3, along with an exploration of the potential of NFT technology and its benefits. We also analyzed the most commonly used DeFi and Layer 2 protocols before finally recommending the integration of a targeted Layer 2 protocol to optimize transactions and the sale of NFTs in a corporate context.</br>
              </br>Through this work, we offered clear and detailed guidance to the startup, enabling them to tackle the challenges and opportunities presented by their ambitious initiative. We helped them integrate the latest Web3 technologies and understand the benefits of NFT technology. </br>
              </br>Our approach is not just to respond to our customers' specific requests but also to provide support beyond that, enabling them to navigate and succeed in the evolving world of Web3 technology with confidence.</br>
